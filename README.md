# About me
Hello World!
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow.

## Who is this person?
  Hi, my name is Whitney.
  I'm from the Netherlands and I just started to learn how to code.
  This is a new world to me, hopefully filled with great chances to make the best of life.

  I'm actually a creative person. I like to draw and paint. Both traditionally and digitally.
  What I really *love* to do is making art of horses. I think horses are the most *beautifull* creatures on earth. 
  They move elegantly, they catch my eye. They can be great friends for life and  they live always in honesty.
  
### Career and personal development
  I was a truck driver for 4 years. In those years I learnt a lot about myself and how to deal with different circumstances. 
  When I wanted to get my Truck driving license, most of the people who knew I was going for that license thought I couldn't  do that because I was a young small creative girl ( I was 22 ).
  With my experience in my previous workfield I found out that (heavy) physical work is not meant for me. Also monotonous work bores me. 
  I'll never go against my biorhythm again (starting before 7:00), that is even more harmfull to mind and body than the physical work.
  I have learnt what to accept and not to accept from other people or employers. 
  I have grown from a super shy and anxious person to a more self-confident person. 
  I'm still not where I'm supposed to be, or what I want to be. But I have learnt that change comes from taking risks or getting out of your 'not so comfort' zone.
  And I know my worth.

### So why do I want to learn programming?
  I think it is a great skill to have. If you are good you can get paid well. 
  
  My highest diploma is HAVO (NL)/ senior general secondary school  (EN). It's possible for me to get a bachlors degree if I finish one.
  I could get a challenging job, just working inside an office, with normal start times. I finish on time and still have an evening to spend time with my dog and my partner.
  That's what I want for my career. Having a nice job, paid well and have plenty of time to relax or learn something else. I think I would not feel like I'm working to hard for what I get paid for.
  It would not cost me my health as much like the job I had before. It would also cost me less time and energy for the same amount I used to make with my previous job. I think.

  Programming is something I can start right now. I have acces straight away from my desk. 
  There are a lot of free courses online and it would give me some steps ahead before I start an education in programming.

  Because I have to work, I have to follow a part-time study. Most of the other bachlors (not computer science related) are full-time study's, and then I would not even know if I really like the program.
  Programming bootcamps sound safe, it doesn't consume all of my time, I learn a new skill and if I want I can continue a part-time bachlor study while I'm working. It could be a Win-Win situation.

  Another reason for me to learn programming is that I can use the knowledge for personal use. I can create my own projects and hopefully I could make a game or an app in the future.
  Also, I am someone who always asks: "Why?". And when a piece of code works, I get excited.
  That's why I think programming suits me. 
  The big questions is: Will I succeed learning this skill?

### Interests
  First of all, my biggest interest is creating art. 
  You can think of: drawing, painting and sculpting. Both traditonally and digitally.
  Most of the time, animals are the main thing I like to make art of.
  
  I also like to play games (horse games, fantasy mmorpg, browser/text-based games). I've always wondered how someone could 'make' that kind of game. I also imagined my version of several games I played.
  I knew I had to have programming skills and other programs for creating the userinterface and art. But I just thought I couldn't do that. I did not believe I could be a developer too.
  One thing that is simple but true: If you really want it, you can do it. 
  If you believe in yourself, you can do it. 
  Everyone had to start somewhere. 

  I also have an interest in building websites, but I just know little about it. I know a little bit of HTML and CSS. 
  I want to learn how to build a website that's safe for users. For example: building webshops, porfolio's or company websites. I don't know much about servers yet.

  3D modelling is also a skill i would like to grow in. I like to create character concept art and bring it to life through 3D modelling.
